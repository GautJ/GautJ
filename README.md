👋  
Hi, I’m @GautJ (Gauthier Jeannin).

📚  
I’m a second-year student at Mines Paris, the #2 best scientific school in France, with a passion for Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics!

🔭  
I have just completed a research internship in high-energy particle physics, where I applied cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including CNNs and Transformers, to analyze data from the H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) telescopes.

👨‍💻  
I’m about to start my first gap-year internship as a Software Engineer at Wiremind, where I will focus on developing scalable solutions in the passenger transport sector.  
I am now actively looking for a second gap-year internship in **Software Engineering** or **Data Science**, ideally starting in **January 2026**. If you’re hiring, feel free to reach out!
