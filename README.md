👋 
Hi, I’m @GautJ (Gauthier Jeannin). 

📚 
I’m a second-year student at Mines Paris, the #2 best scientific school in France, and I have a passion for Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics!

🔭
Currently, I am doing a research internship in high-energy particle physics, where I utilize state-of-the-art machine learning methods, such as CNNs 
and Transformers, to analyze data from the H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) telescopes.

👨‍💻
I am actively seeking an internship in software engineering or data science, so please feel free to reach out!
